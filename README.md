# Travel Community Experience Finder

## Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with Flight Centre Travel Group to explore the preferences and behaviours of younger travellers. The goal is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that assesses technical feasibility and market interest. A fully developed application is not required; instead, the focus has been on user research and thoughtful design to ensure functionality aligns with real user needs.

Research findings indicated that younger users value multimedia, user-generated content and often find trip planning frustrating when switching between multiple apps. Our concept combines social media-style travel content with integrated itinerary and trip planning tools to create a smoother, more engaging travel planning experience.

## Key Features (Planned / Partial Implementation)
- User login & logout
- User profile page
- Content upload interface
- Homepage with suggested posts/videos
- Search page with filters
- Messaging/chat system
- Points exchange for rewards
- Itinerary builder
- Responsive layout for desktop & mobile (Implemented)

## Limitations
