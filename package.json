  "description": "## Overview This project was developed in collaboration with Flight Centre Travel Group to explore the preferences and behaviours of younger travellers. The goal is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that assesses technical feasibility and market interest. A fully developed application is not required; instead, the focus has been on user research and thoughtful design to ensure functionality aligns with real user needs.",
